# K-Track

## About this project

In 2021, to learn JavaScript, I created a web-app called [K-Track](https://keshuook.github.io/software/k-track/). This web-app was a response to my family's need for a no nonsense app on which they could store and manage shopping lists. 5 Years later, with many many more hours of software development experience under my belt, I have re-created this using Dart and Flutter, adding all the features I felt the initial app lacked. This repository contains the code for the project.

## Usage

When you open the app, you're greeted with a screen containing all your TODO lists.

From here, you can create new lists by using the input box on the bottom or rename/delete them. This is done by long pressing the list you want to edit.

Clicking on the list allows you to access it. From here you can add new items to the list, check them off the list and delete items.
