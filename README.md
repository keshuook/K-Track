# K-Track

## About this project

In 2021, to learn JavaScript, I created a web app called [K-Track](https://keshuook.github.io/software/k-track/). This web app was a response to my family's need for a no-nonsense app to store and manage shopping lists. 5 Years later, with many, many more hours of software development experience under my belt, I re-created this using Dart and Flutter, adding all the features I felt the initial app lacked. This repository contains the code for the project.

## Usage

When you open the app, you're greeted with a screen containing all your TODO lists.

From here, you can create new lists by using the input box at the bottom or rename/delete them. This is done by long-pressing the list you want to edit.

Clicking the list opens it. From here, you can add new items to the list, check them off the list and delete items.
